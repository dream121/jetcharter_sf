                    <p>At JetCharters.com, we recognize safety is a top priority. Every aircraft listed on our website is required by the FAA to comply with Part 135 rules and regulations. FAA Part 135 is the operating standard at which aircraft safety, regulations, maintenance, and pilot licensure are ensured.<br><br>Additionally, many of our charter providers take the priority of your safety to the next level by having independent auditors do on-site safety audits. While searching the JetCharters.com air charter marketplace, consider looking for the Argus seal.<br><br><strong>About the ARGUS Ratings:</strong><br><br>The ARGUS CHEQ (Charter Evaluation and Qualification) program was developed over a decade ago as the most accurate and detailed third-party due diligence system for charter operators, buyers and passengers around the world. With ARGUS CHEQ you can fly confidently:<ul><li style=\"margin-left:15px;\">Knowing your operator's safety history</li> <li style=\"margin-left:15px;\">By confirming your operator's commercial status</li></ul>Knowing your operator's safety history By confirming your operator's commercial status<br><br>ARGUS extracts, filters, and vetts data on charter operators around the world through the CHEQ Program. To qualify for a Gold Rating, ARGUS uses a proprietary algorithm that has formed the foundation of the only rating system in the business jet charter marketplace. This scoring system is the backbone of CHEQ and provides charter buyers with an independent, third-party, factually-based rating on an operator's actual safety history. The ARGUS Ratings are as follows:<br><br><strong>DNQ Rating - An ARGUS rating of DNQ (Does Not Qualify) can result from:</strong><br><br>1) A poor historical safety score based on the data collected and analyzed<br>2) A significant safety issue with a pilot or aircraft operated<br>3) A failure of an on-site safety audit<br><br><strong>Gold Rating</strong> - To achieve the Gold Rating, ARGUS conducts in-depth research into numerous databases and other reputable sources. Historical information on the commercial certificate, pilots, aircraft serial numbers, ownership, management and financial data is compiled, processed and scored in an effort to determine the applicability of a Gold Rating. An operator's composite score is compared against an aggregate group of operators with like exposures, and if found to meet or exceed the median score of those operators, the operator will be granted an ARGUS Gold Rating. If that score meets or exceeds the median score of those operators, the operator will be granted an ARGUS Gold Rating.<br><br><strong>Gold Plus Rating</strong> - The Gold Plus Rating is awarded to operators who meet all Gold Rating requirements and have completed an ARGUS on-site safety audit or maintains IS-BAO (International Standard for Business Aircraft Operations) Stage 1 registry. The operation is audited against the ARGUS Platinum Standard, a standard developed by ARGUS in conjunction with the industry, which contains recognized best practices, policies and procedures. Operators that meet these requirements are eligible to receive a Gold Plus Rating.<br><br><strong>Platinum Rating</strong> - The Platinum Rating is the highest level of the ARGUS Ratings. It is awarded to those experienced operators who meet the criteria for Gold and completed the ARGUS Platinum on-site safety audit. A Platinum Rating requires a well-developed Safety Management System, a clear and workable Emergency Response Plan, effective policies and procedures, and documented records for all major aspects of Operations and Maintenance within a flight department or charter company.<br><br><strong>About ARGUS</strong><br><br>ARGUS International Inc.
